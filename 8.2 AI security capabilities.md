# AI security capabilities

## What tools and capabilities do we have to secure AI systems currently?

Currently, there are several tools and capabilities available to secure AI systems:

-   **Counterfit**: An open-source automation tool for security testing of AI systems, designed to help organizations conduct AI security risk assessments and ensure the robustness of their algorithms.
-   **Adversarial Machine Learning Tools**: These tools evaluate the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks, helping to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
-   **AI Security Toolkits**: There are open-source toolkits available that provide resources for securing AI systems, including libraries and frameworks for implementing security measures.
-   **Collaborative Platforms**: Partnerships between companies and AI communities to develop AI-specific security scanners and other tools to secure the AI supply chain.

These tools and capabilities are part of a growing field dedicated to enhancing the security of AI systems against a variety of threats. They represent a combination of research, practical tools, and industry collaboration aimed at addressing the unique challenges posed by AI technologies.

## What about AI red teaming? How does that differ from traditional security red teaming?

AI red teaming differs from traditional security red teaming in several key aspects:

-   **Focus on AI Systems**: AI red teaming specifically targets the unique vulnerabilities of AI systems, such as machine learning models and data pipelines, rather than traditional IT infrastructure.
-   **Testing AI Behavior**: It involves testing how AI systems respond to unusual or unexpected inputs, which can reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
-   **Exploring AI Failures**: AI red teaming looks at both malicious and benign failures, considering a broader set of personas and potential system failures beyond just security breaches.
-   **Prompt Injection and Content Generation**: AI red teaming also includes probing for failures like prompt injection, where attackers manipulate AI systems to produce harmful or ungrounded content.
-   **Ethical and Responsible AI**: It’s part of ensuring responsible AI by design, making sure AI systems are robust against attempts to make them behave in unintended ways.

Overall, AI red teaming is an expanded practice that not only covers probing for security vulnerabilities but also includes testing for other types of system failures specific to AI technologies. It’s a crucial part of developing safer AI systems by understanding and mitigating novel risks associated with AI deployment.
