# üöÄ Cybersecurity for Beginners ‚Äì a curriculum

In this rapidly changing age of AI technology adoption, it is even more critical to understand how to secure IT systems. This course is designed to teach you fundamental cyber security concepts to kick-start your security learning. It is vendor agnostic and is divided into small lessons that should take around 30-60 mins to complete. Each lesson has a small quiz and links to further reading if you want to dive into the topic a bit more.

When you have finished this course, you can move onto some of our Microsoft Learn modules. We recommend you continue your learning with  [Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals.](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/describe-concepts-of-security-compliance-identity/?WT.mc_id=academic-96948-sayoung) 

Ultimately, you could consider taking the [Exam SC-900: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals exam.](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-900/?WT.mc_id=academic-96948-sayoung)
