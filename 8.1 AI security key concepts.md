# AI security key concepts

## How does AI security differ from traditional cyber security?

Securing AI systems presents unique challenges compared to traditional cybersecurity, mainly due to the nature of AI’s learning capabilities and decision-making processes. Here are some key differences:

-   **Data Integrity**: AI systems rely heavily on data for learning. [Ensuring the integrity of this data is crucial, as attackers can manipulate the data to influence AI behavior, a tactic known as data poisoning
-   **Model Security**: The AI’s decision-making model itself can be a target. [Attackers may attempt to reverse-engineer the model or exploit its weaknesses to make incorrect or harmful decisions
-   **Adversarial Attacks**: AI systems can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where slight, often imperceptible alterations to input data can cause the AI to make errors or incorrect predictions
-   **Infrastructure Security**: While traditional cybersecurity also focuses on protecting infrastructure, AI systems may have additional layers of complexity, such as cloud-based services or specialized hardware, that require specific security measures
-   **Ethical Considerations**: The use of AI in security brings ethical considerations, such as privacy concerns and the potential for bias in decision-making, which must be addressed in the security strategy

Overall, securing AI systems requires a different approach that considers the unique aspects of AI technology, including the protection of data, models, and the AI’s learning process, while also addressing the ethical implications of AI deployment

  
AI security and traditional cybersecurity share many similarities, but they also have some distinct differences due to the unique characteristics and capabilities of artificial intelligence systems. Here's how they differ:

- **Complexity of Threats**: AI systems introduce new layers of complexity to cybersecurity. Traditional cybersecurity primarily deals with threats like malware, phishing attacks, and network intrusions. However, AI systems can be vulnerable to attacks such as adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model evasion, which specifically target the machine learning algorithms themselves.

- **Attack Surface**: AI systems often have larger attack surfaces compared to traditional systems. This is because they not only rely on software but also on data and models. Attackers can target the training data, manipulate models, or exploit vulnerabilities in the algorithms themselves.

 - **Adaptability of Threats**: AI systems can adapt and learn from their environment, which can make them more susceptible to adaptive and evolving threats. Traditional cybersecurity measures may not be sufficient to defend against attacks that constantly evolve based on the behavior of the AI system.
   
 - **Interpretability and Explainability**: Understanding why an AI system made a particular decision is often more challenging compared to traditional software systems. This lack of interpretability and explainability can make it difficult to detect and mitigate attacks  on AI systems effectively.

   
  

 - **Data Privacy Concerns**: AI systems often rely on large amounts of data, which can introduce privacy risks if not properly handled. Traditional cybersecurity measures may not adequately address these data privacy concerns specific to AI systems.

   
   

 - **Regulatory Compliance**: The regulatory landscape for AI security is still evolving, with specific regulations and standards emerging to address the unique challenges posed by AI systems. Traditional cybersecurity frameworks may need to be extended or adapted to ensure compliance with these new regulations.

   
   

 - **Ethical Considerations**: AI security involves not only protecting systems from malicious attacks but also ensuring that AI systems are used in an ethical and responsible manner. This includes considerations such as fairness, transparency, and accountability, which may not be as prominent in traditional cybersecurity.


## How is AI the same as securing traditional IT systems?

Securing AI systems shares several fundamental principles with traditional cybersecurity:

-   **Threat Protection**: Both AI and traditional systems need to be safeguarded against unauthorized access, data modification, and destruction, as well as other common threats.
-   **Vulnerability Management**: Many vulnerabilities that affect traditional systems, such as software bugs or misconfigurations, can also impact AI systems.
-   **Data Security**: The protection of processed data is crucial in both domains to prevent data breaches and ensure confidentiality.
-   **Supply Chain Security**: Both types of systems are susceptible to supply chain attacks, where a compromised component can undermine the security of the entire system.

These similarities highlight that while AI systems introduce new security challenges, they also require the application of established cybersecurity practices to ensure robust protection. It’s a blend of leveraging traditional security wisdom while adapting to the unique aspects of AI technology.
