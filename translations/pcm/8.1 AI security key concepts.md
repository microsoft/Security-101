## How AI security take different from traditional cyber security?

To secure AI systems dey get dia own wahala wey different from normal cybersecurity, because of how AI dey learn and make decisions. Dis na some key difference:

-   **Data Integrity**: AI systems dey depend well well on data to learn. [To make sure say dis data dey correct na very important, because bad people fit change the data to make AI behave anyhow, dem dey call am data poisoning.
-   **Model Security**: The AI decision-making model fit be target too. [Bad people fit try to understand how the model work or use the weak points to make am do wrong or bad things.
-   **Adversarial Attacks**: AI systems fit dey open to attacks wey small changes wey person no go even notice for input data fit make AI make mistake or wrong predictions.
-   **Infrastructure Security**: Even though normal cybersecurity dey protect infrastructure, AI systems get extra wahala like cloud services or special hardware wey need special security.
-   **Ethical Considerations**: To use AI for security get moral wahala like privacy matter and bias for decision-making, wey dem need to handle well for the security plan.

To secure AI systems, e need different style wey go consider how AI dey work, like to protect data, models, and how AI dey learn, plus to think about the moral matter wey dey follow AI use.

AI security and normal cybersecurity get plenty things wey dem dey do alike, but dem still get some difference because of how AI systems dey work. Dis na how dem take different:

- **Complexity of Threats**: AI systems dey add new wahala for cybersecurity. Normal cybersecurity dey face wahala like malware, phishing, and network attacks. But AI systems fit get wahala like adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model evasion wey dey target the machine learning algorithms.

- **Attack Surface**: AI systems dey get bigger attack surface pass normal systems. Dis na because dem dey depend on software, data, and models. Bad people fit target the training data, change models, or use the weak points for the algorithms.

 - **Adaptability of Threats**: AI systems fit dey learn and change based on wetin dey happen around dem, and dis fit make dem open to wahala wey dey change and grow. Normal cybersecurity fit no strong enough to stop attacks wey dey change based on how AI dey behave.
   
 - **Interpretability and Explainability**: To understand why AI system make one decision fit hard pass normal software systems. Dis wahala fit make am hard to see and stop attacks for AI systems well.

   
  

 - **Data Privacy Concerns**: AI systems dey use plenty data, and dis fit bring privacy wahala if dem no handle am well. Normal cybersecurity fit no fit handle dis privacy wahala wey dey follow AI systems.

   
   

 - **Regulatory Compliance**: The rules wey dey guide AI security still dey grow, and new rules and standards dey come out to handle the wahala wey AI systems dey bring. Normal cybersecurity rules fit need to change or add new things to follow dis new rules.

   
   

 - **Ethical Considerations**: AI security no be only to protect systems from bad people, e also mean say AI systems go dey used in way wey dey fair and responsible. Dis include things like fairness, transparency, and accountability wey no dey too much for normal cybersecurity.


## How AI and normal IT systems dey the same for security?

To secure AI systems get some basic things wey e share with normal cybersecurity:

-   **Threat Protection**: Both AI and normal systems need protection from people wey no suppose enter, change data, or destroy things, plus other wahala.
-   **Vulnerability Management**: Many wahala wey dey affect normal systems like software problems or wrong settings fit affect AI systems too.
-   **Data Security**: To protect data wey dem dey process dey very important for both AI and normal systems to stop data wahala and keep am private.
-   **Supply Chain Security**: Both systems fit get wahala from supply chain attacks, where one bad part fit spoil the whole system.

Dis similarities show say even though AI systems dey bring new security wahala, dem still need to use the normal cybersecurity ways to protect dem well. E be like mix of old security sense and new ways for AI technology.
