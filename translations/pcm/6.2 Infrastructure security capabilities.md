**Introduction**

For dis lesson, we go talk about:

- Wetin be vulnerability management?

- Wetin be CSPM?

- Wetin be CNAPP?

## Wetin be vulnerability management?

Vulnerability management na di process wey dem dey use to find, check, arrange, fix, and dey monitor vulnerabilities for computer systems, software, networks, and infrastructure. Di main goal na to reduce di risk wey fit happen to di organization by fixing di vulnerabilities before bad people go use am. Dis na di main steps:

Identification: Use scan to find vulnerabilities for di organization assets like servers, applications, network devices, and endpoints.

Assessment: Check how serious di vulnerability be and wetin e fit cause based on things like di Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score and di business context.

Prioritization: Arrange di vulnerabilities based on di risk level and how e fit affect di organization work and data.

Mitigation: Plan and do wetin go fix or reduce di vulnerabilities, like apply patches, set security settings, or use other controls.

Verification: Make sure say di things wey dem do to fix di vulnerabilities work well.

Continuous Monitoring: Dey always check di vulnerabilities and di threats wey fit happen, dey do regular scans and assessments.

Vulnerability management na one important part of cybersecurity, e dey help organizations keep their security strong and reduce di chance of security wahala. Examples of vulnerability management tools na Defender for Cloud, Nessus, and Qualys.

## Wetin be CSPM?

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) na tools, processes, and practices wey dem dey use to check, monitor, and make sure say di security settings and best practices for cloud dey okay. CSPM dey help organizations find and fix misconfigurations, security gaps, and compliance wahala for their cloud infrastructure, like for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and other cloud providers.

Di main things wey CSPM dey do include:

- Configuration Assessment: Scan cloud resources and services to find misconfigurations, insecure settings, and wetin no follow security best practices.

- Security Policy Enforcement: Make sure say di security policies and compliance standards dey okay for di cloud environments by fixing misconfigurations automatically or sending alerts.

- Continuous Monitoring: Dey always check di security of cloud assets and resources, dey give real-time alerts for security wahala.

- Compliance Reporting: Create reports and dashboards to show say di organization dey follow regulatory requirements and industry standards.

CSPM dey help organizations make sure say their cloud infrastructure dey secure, dey follow compliance, and dey follow best practices, e dey reduce di risk of cloud security wahala. Examples of CSPM tools na Defender for Cloud and Snyk.

## Wetin be CNAPP?

CNAPP mean Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform. E be one all-in-one cloud-native software platform wey dey make am easy to monitor, detect, and act on cloud security threats and vulnerabilities. E join plenty tools and features together for one software to reduce complexity and help DevOps and DevSecOps teams work better. CNAPP dey provide end-to-end cloud and application security for di whole CI/CD application lifecycle, from development to production. E dey handle di need for modern cloud security monitoring, posture management, breach prevention, and control tools. CNAPP dey give security teams di power to measure and respond to risks for di cloud environment. Some of di features of CNAPP include better visibility, risk measurement, secure software development, and one combined cloud security solution. CNAPP dey join different cloud security solutions wey before dey separate into one user interface, so e go dey easy for organizations to protect their whole cloud application footprint. CNAPP dey combine different cloud-native security tools and data sources, like container scanning, cloud security posture management, infrastructure as code scanning, cloud infrastructure entitlements management, and runtime cloud workload protection platforms.
